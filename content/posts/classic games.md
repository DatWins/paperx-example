This time, we're looking at a FICS blitz game from 2008. One of the strongest atomic players, siggemannen, takes the black pieces against luckybbad in a 3 minute, no increment game.

## luckybbad (1934) - siggemannen (2306), 3+0, FICS 2008-11-02 ##

{{< mainline >}}1. e3 e6 2. Qf3 f5 3. Qh5+ g6 4. Qh4{{< /mainline >}}

White opts to trade queens early. This particular line might be criticised in some quarters as unambitious. It doesn't press white's starting move advantage and takes both players straight into a playable queenless middlegame. Such a situation tends to favour the more skilled player.

{{< mainline >}}4...Qxh4 5. Nf3 e5{{< /mainline >}}

Black cannot defend both invasions on e5 and g5, but white's knight alone is not too dangerous and black can play around it. A white knight on d7 can be annoying (guarding f8 and preventing castling and f-file attacking ideas), so with the text move black prevents Ne5-d7 ideas. Other plausible choices include 5...Nf6, 5...Nc6 and 5...Bg7.

{{< mainline >}}6. Ng5 Nf6 7. f3{{< /mainline >}}

The most logical move. Black was threatening ...Ne4; for instance 7. Ne6?? Bb4 8. Nc3 Ne4 is mating. Another option was 7. Nc3 Bb4 (7...Ng4 8. f3 Bb4 transposes) 8. f3 Ng4 9. Nxh7 Nxh2 with a pawn structure similar to the game.

{{< mainline >}}7...Ng4 8. Nxh7 Nxh2{{< /mainline >}}
