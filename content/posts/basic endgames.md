## KQ v K ##
A queen is the only piece that can checkmate alone. The "technique" is basically to ensure the kings don't get connected, else it's completely drawn.

This endgame arises as a simplification from many other won endgames, usually by sacrificing a piece for a pawn to leave your own passed pawn, promoting it and cutting the enemy king off before it gets adjacent to yours.
