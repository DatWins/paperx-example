Amateurs often have no clue of how to use center/space advantage, instead keen on forcing continuations, and 
unjustified attacks.

## Rules of center

### Rule 1. Full pawn center gives control and space.

**A full pawn center gives its owner territory and control over key central squares.**

### Rule 2. Owning a center is responsibility.

**Owning a full pawn center is a responsibility. You must make it indestructible, and you will cramp your opponent.**

### Rule 3. Don't advance center too early.

**Don't advance the center too early! Every pawn move weakens some squares.**

In the following example, advancing e-pawn allows the Knight jump to d5 and f5.

### Rule 4. Attack your opponent's full pawn center.

One of the most common cases of allowing a "string" center in order to attack it is in the 
_Alekhine's Defense_.

{{< admonition type=note title="Tips from the game" open=true >}}
* Passive planless play leads to loss.
* Play on the center > wings.
* Know what the opponent is planning, but don't allow yourself become mesmerized by his ideas. 
Your plans should prove stronger than theirs.
* Don't make pointless one-move attacks!!! **Always** expect your opponent to see your threats.
